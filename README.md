# Portfolio
The HTML portfolio repository is designed to showcase the creator's skills, projects, and achievements in a structured and visually appealing manner.
It enables easy version control, collaboration, and sharing of the portfolio, making it a valuable asset for individuals looking to highlight their work in web development, design, or other creative fields.


This repository typically includes HTML, CSS files, along with any associated images, stylesheets, and other resources required for the proper functioning and visual appeal of the portfolio.
